# Arbitrum EcoSaver

## Project Overview

Arbitrum EcoSaver is an energy-efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to optimize gas usage while offering a suite of financial services such as lending, borrowing, and staking. Built using Stylus contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia, EcoSaver leverages the cost efficiency and interoperability of Stylus to provide an innovative and environmentally friendly solution for DeFi users.

## Problem

Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications are often plagued by high gas fees and inefficient transaction processing, which can deter users and limit the scalability of the ecosystem. Traditional EVM contracts consume significant computational resources, resulting in elevated costs and environmental impact.

## Solution

Arbitrum EcoSaver addresses these issues by:
1. **Reducing Gas Fees**: Utilizing Stylus contracts, written in Rust, to achieve significantly lower gas costs compared to traditional EVM contracts.
2. **Optimizing Transaction Efficiency**: Implementing an optimized transaction routing algorithm to further minimize gas consumption.
3. **Seamless EVM Integration**: Ensuring full interoperability with existing EVM contracts to provide a smooth and cohesive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Stylus (Rust)**: For writing energy-efficient smart contracts.
- **Arbitrum Sepolia**: The test network for deploying and testing the Stylus contracts.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Web3.js and Ethers.js**: For interacting with the smart contracts from the frontend.
- **Chart.js**: For creating real-time analytics and visualization.

## Platform Features

### 1. Lending and Borrowing
- **Lending**: Users can lend their crypto assets to earn interest, utilizing gas-efficient Stylus contracts.
- **Borrowing**: Users can borrow against their holdings, with optimized gas costs.

### 2. EcoSaver Wallet
- A user-friendly wallet interface that supports Stylus contracts.
- Features gas fee estimation and optimization tips to enhance user experience.

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
- A comprehensive dashboard that tracks gas savings and environmental impact.
- Provides insights into user savings and efficiency improvements.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask or any compatible wallet to connect to the EcoSaver platform.
2. **Lend and Borrow**: Interact with the lending and borrowing functionalities through the user interface.
3. **Track Savings**: Monitor your gas savings and environmental impact through the analytics dashboard.
